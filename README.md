## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
What is the background of your project?
*This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 

Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 

If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
*HEre we are trying to understand the driving factors behind loan default, the variables which are strong indicators of default.

What is the dataset that is being used?
*LDS


## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1: Most of the defaulters are having employment experience between 4-6 years, company should be careful while lending loans to the employees having less experience.
- Conclusion 2: customers between 10K-20K$ annual income can likely to be instable in managing their finances and hence fall under defaulters.
- Conclusion 3: There are more outliers on revolving balance which means the credit health is more on them.
- Conclusion 4: As expected the revol_util % is high for most of the defaulters. Average percentage being 60% which is a high value and shows bad credit score.
